    "There are specific set of rules for mapping from war binary byte strings (like: 01110011001100) to characters which can be easily understood by humans (ex: \"Hello\"). These specific set of rules is called **Character Encodings.** There are different types of encodings, and if we try to read in a text with a different encoding with which it was originally written in, then we see scrambled text called \"mojibake\", e.g.:\n",
    "> æ–‡å—åŒ–ã?? \n",
